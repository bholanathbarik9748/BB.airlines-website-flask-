                <h2>What is Services ?</h2>
                <p><br></p>
                <p1>
                    A service is a transaction in which no physical goods are transferred from the seller to the buyer.
                    The
                    benefits of such a service are held to be demonstrated by the buyer's willingness to make the
                    exchange.
                    Public services are those that society (nation state, fiscal union or region) as a whole pays for.
                    Using
                    resources, skill, ingenuity, and experience, service providers benefit service consumers. Service is
                    intangible in nature.
                    In a narrower sense, service refers to quality of customer service: the measured appropriateness of
                    assistance and support provided to a customer. This particular usage occurs frequently in retailing.

                <p1>
                    Airline and delivery of services must be mastered for a service provider to expand. This can be seen
                    as a problem of service quality. Both inputs and outputs to the processes involved providing
                    services are
                    highly variable, as are the relationships between these processes, making it difficult to maintain
                    consistent service quality. Many services involve variable human activity, rather than a precisely
                    determined process; exceptions include utilities. The human factor is often the key success factor
                    in
                    service provision. Demand can vary by season, time of day, business cycle, etc. Consistency is
                    necessary to
                    create enduring business relationships.

                            that allowed passengers to check out other passengers Facebook or LinkedIn profiles before
                            selecting seats. This could be quite an interesting feature, particularly for long flights
                            if passengers are looking to meet new and interesting people. Obviously, the feature
                            requires passenger consent but could certainly be a little creepy!

                            The German airline Germanwings allows passengers to select a broad range of requirements for
                            a trip, such as shopping or partying, and then after selecting your dates, it allows
                            passengers to “book blind” so to speak. You don’t find out the destination you are flying to
                            until after booking, and if you’re not satisfied with playing travel roulette then tough
                            luck. It’s the true modern-day form of sticking a pin in a map and seeing where you go!
                            Exciting or terrifying, take your pick.

                            Air New-Zealand has offered a “cuddle-class” on some of its very long haul flights in
                            economy. For a select amount of passengers traveling in a pair, there is the option to buy a
                            third seat for half the price. The benefit of this is that the three seats together in
                            economy can be converted into a bed by a cleaver fold-out feature where passengers legs
                            normally are.

                            but the Australian airline Qantas now offers passengers VR headsets to pass the time. The

                            and even Australian national parks.

                            Air Malta introduced an onboard spa and massage service for economy passengers back in 2015.
                            Air Malta said they wanted to push smaller projects to increase passenger satisfaction, and
                            free head and shoulder massages on select flights for all passengers was just the start of
                            this. As you can imagine, the service has proved very popular.
