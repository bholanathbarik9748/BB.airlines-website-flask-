        B.B airline is a company that provides air transport services for traveling passengers and freight. Airlines
        utilize aircraft to supply these services and may form partnerships or alliances with other airlines for
        codeshare agreements, in which they both offer and operate the same flight. Generally, airline companies are
        recognized with an air operating certificate or license issued by a governmental aviation body. Airlines may be
        scheduled or charter operators.

        The first airline was the German airship company DELAG, founded on 16 November 1909.[1] The four oldest
        non-airship airlines that still exist are the Netherlands' KLM (1919),[2] Colombia's Avianca (1919),[3]
        Australia's Qantas (1921)[4] and the Czech Republic's Czech Airlines (1923).[5]

        Airline ownership has seen a shift from mostly personal ownership until the 1930s to government-ownership of
        major airlines from the 1940s to 1980s and back to large-scale privatization following the mid-1980s.[6] Since
        the 1980s, there has also been a trend of major airline mergers and the formation of airline alliances.[7] The
        largest alliances are Star Alliance, SkyTeam and Oneworld, and these three collectively accounted for more than
        60% of global commercial air traffic in 2015.[8] Airline alliances coordinate their passenger service programs
        (such as lounges and frequent-flyer programs), offer special interline tickets and often engage in extensive
        codesharing (sometimes systemwide).

        As of 2019, the largest airline by passengers carried and fleet size was the American Airlines Group, while
        Delta Air Lines was the largest by revenue. Lufthansa Group was the largest by number of employees, FedEx
        Express by freight tonne-kilometres, Turkish Airlines by number of countries served and UPS Airlines by number
        of destinations served[9] (though United Airlines was the largest passenger airline by number of destinations
        served).<br>

        Costs

        BMI in an effort to reduce operating costs.[79]
        Airlines have substantial fixed and operating costs to establish and maintain air services: labor, fuel,
        airplanes, engines, spares and parts, IT services and networks, airport equipment, airport handling services,
        booking commissions, advertising, catering, training, aviation insurance and other costs. Thus all but a small
        percentage of the income from ticket sales is paid out to a wide variety of external providers or internal cost
        centers.

        Moreover, the industry is structured so that airlines often act as tax collectors. Airline fuel is untaxed
        because of a series of treaties existing between countries. Ticket prices include a number of fees, taxes and
        surcharges beyond the control of airlines. Airlines are also responsible for enforcing government regulations.
        If airlines carry passengers without proper documentation on an international flight, they are responsible for
        returning them back to the original country.

        Analysis of the 1992–1996 period shows that every player in the air transport chain is far more profitable than
        the airlines, who collect and pass through fees and revenues to them from ticket sales. While airlines as a
        whole earned 6% return on capital employed (2–3.5% less than the cost of capital), airports earned 10%, catering
        companies 10–13%, handling companies 11–14%, aircraft lessors 15%, aircraft manufacturers 16%, and global
        distribution companies more than 30%.[80]

        There has been continuing cost competition from low cost airlines. Many companies emulate Southwest Airlines in
        various respects.[81] The lines between full-service and low-cost airlines have become blurred – e.g., with most
        "full service" airlines introducing baggage check fees despite Southwest not doing so.

        Many airlines in the U.S. and elsewhere have experienced business difficulty. U.S. airlines that have declared
        Chapter 11 bankruptcy since 1990 have included American Airlines, Continental Airlines (twice), Delta Air Lines,
        Northwest Airlines, Pan Am, United Airlines and US Airways (twice).

        Where an airline has established an engineering base at an airport, then there may be considerable economic
        advantages in using that same airport as a preferred focus (or "hub") for its scheduled flights.

        Fuel hedging is a contractual tool used by transportation companies like airlines to reduce their exposure to
        volatile and potentially rising fuel costs. Several low-cost carriers such as Southwest Airlines adopt this
        practice. Southwest is credited with maintaining strong business profits between 1999 and the early 2000s due to
        its fuel hedging policy. Many other airlines are replicating Southwest's hedging policy to control their fuel
        costs.[82]

        Operating costs for US major airlines are primarily aircraft operating expense including jet fuel, aircraft
        maintenance, depreciation and aircrew for 44%, servicing expense for 29% (traffic 11%, passenger 11% and
        aircraft 7%), 14% for reservations and sales and 13% for overheads (administration 6% and advertising 2%). An
        average US major Boeing 757-200 flies 1,252 mi (2,015 km) stages 11.3 block hours per day and costs $2,550 per
        block hour: $923 of ownership, $590 of maintenance, $548 of fuel and $489 of crew; or $13.34 per 186 seats per
        block hour. For a Boeing 737-500, a low-cost carrier like Southwest have lower operating costs at $1,526 than a
        full service one like United at $2,974, and higher productivity with 399,746 ASM per day against 264,284,
        resulting in a unit cost of 0.38 $cts/ASM against 1.13 $cts/ASM.[83]

        McKinsey observes that "newer technology, larger aircraft, and increasingly efficient operations continually
        drive down the cost of running an airline", from nearly 40 US cents per ASK at the beginning of the jet age, to
        just above 10 cents since 2000. Those improvements were passed onto the customer due to high competition: fares
        have been falling throughout the history of airlines
